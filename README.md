Right now I have everythin working.
Have three heuristics, but the behavior of them has to be a bit fine tuned
right now having an issue with infinite recursion issues, but I think I have that figured out but there may be a better way to protect against that 

Not sure if I am doing alpha-beta pruning and need to set values for weights, but right now I have something that runs and I can consitently reach 256, and its nearing where it can make some more intelligent choices to improve its behavior

but this is manageable

will return for clean up later
